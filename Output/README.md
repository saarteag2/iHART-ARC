## README for Output ##

The “Output” directory was created as directory to organize output from the annotation and classification pipeline. The directory consists of two empty subdirectories titled, “Annotation” and “Classification.” The “Annotation” subdirectory will hold output from Steps 1-6, while the “Classification” subdirectory will hold output from Steps 7-8.
